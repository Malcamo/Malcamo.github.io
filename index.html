    Each tag does something different. For example:
        - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
        - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

                And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;
                There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,
                It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard,
                It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips,
                For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.

                They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy,
                They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,
                And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,
                And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross,
                The cold queen of England is looking in the glass;
                The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;
                From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun,

                Dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard,
                Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred,
                Where, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall,
                The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall,
                The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung,
                That once went singing southward when all the world was young,
                In that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid,
                Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade.

                Don John of Austria is going to the war,
                Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold
                In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold,
                Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,
                Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes.
                Don John laughing in the brave beard curled,
                Spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world,
                Holding his head up for a flag of all the free.
                Love-light of Spain—hurrah!
                Death-light of Africa!
                Don John of Austria

                He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri’s knees,
                His turban that is woven of the sunset and the seas.
                He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease,
                And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees,
                And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring
                Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing.
                Giants and the Genii,
                Multiplex of wing and eye,
