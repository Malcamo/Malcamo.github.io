                White founts falling in the courts of the sun,
                And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;
                There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,
                It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard,
                It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips,
                For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.

                They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy,
                They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,
                And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,
                And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross,
                The cold queen of England is looking in the glass;
                The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;
                From evening isles fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun,
                And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun.

                Dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard,
                Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred,
                Where, risen from a doubtful seat and half attainted stall,
                The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall,
                The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung,
                That once went singing southward when all the world was young,
                In that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid,
                Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade.

                In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold,
                Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,
                Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes.
                Don John laughing in the brave beard curled,
                Spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world,
                Holding his head up for a flag of all the free.
