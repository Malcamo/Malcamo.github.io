                White founts falling in the courts of the sun,
                And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;
                There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,
                It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard,
                It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips,
                For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.

                The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;
